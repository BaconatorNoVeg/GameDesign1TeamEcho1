# Shifting In Space (A game made in GameMaker Studio 2.)
This game is a puzzle platforming game that incorperates 2 controlable charcters with different abilitys. In the game you use the two charcters to traverse through the levels and to solve puzzles. 
One of characters abilitys is to switch places witht the other charcters and to switch the flow of gravity. The other charcter is a larger charcter. He can break walls, pick up boxes, and throwing boxes onto switches.

All of this project was done in gamemaker studio 2. In gamemakerstudio 2 you have to code in Gamemaker Language.

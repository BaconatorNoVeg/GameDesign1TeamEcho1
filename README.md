# Shifting In Space (A game made in GameMaker Studio 2.)
This game is a puzzle platforming game that incorperates 2 controlable charcters with different abilitys. In the game you use the two charcters to traverse through the levels and to solve puzzles. 
One of characters abilitys is to switch places witht the other charcters and to switch the flow of gravity. The other charcter is a larger charcter. He can break walls, pick up boxes, and throwing boxes onto switches.

All of this project was done in gamemaker studio 2. In Gamemaker studio 2 you have to code in Gamemaker Language. Also because this is a game engine there are other parts to this project than coding. This project also included a lot of artwork and level design. Being a puzzle game means that we needed to spend time thinking about the layout of the levels and the way you teach the controls to the player. 
This work was done all within Gamemaker studio. The software has a really good sprite creator allowing us to make every image with the software. 

The levels are created on a TileMap system. You assign what each different state of a square should look like and then you can just paint witht he tilemap. It will automatically determine what piece goes where and reassign the look of the square to match that. That goes on through out all the levels.

In all this game was created in 2 weeks for an assignement in a Game Design 1 class. It was presented in class and it recieved a 120/100.
